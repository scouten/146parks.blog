Tucked away in the mountains west of Omak, the small town of Conconully reminds us all of a quieter time when life ran at a slower pace.

Conconully State Park sits on the edge of Conconully Reservoir and offers a chance to camp, lay low, and just enjoy the water.

This post office isn't technically in the park, but it will give you a flavor of the town itself.
