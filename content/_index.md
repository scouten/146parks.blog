**146 Parks** is a photography and blogging project that I started in 2020 so I could continue exploring while long-distance travel was not viable. Though bigger travel is once again an option, I intend to visit, enjoy, and document all of Washington's state parks.

There's a handy [map](/map) of parks I've visited. Or they're listed below with the most-recently visited parks first.

## See You in Spring 2025!

There are relatively few parks remaining and most of them are bike trails or islands which will be easier or more comfortable to visit during the warmer months next year. I encourage you to <a href="#subscribe">subscribe to my mailing list</a> to follow along on my other travels and catch up when the park-visiting resumes next spring!

See you soon!
