**Hi, I’m Eric.** I'm a photographer and software developer living near Seattle, Washington.

I enjoy traveling worldwide and often blog about my travels on my main site, [ericscouten.com](https://ericscouten.com).

**146 Parks** is a photography and blogging project designed for these times when we need to stay closer to home. By my count, my home state of Washington has 146 state parks. I intend to visit, enjoy, and document them all.

**New (November 2022):** If you want to stay updated for new park posts, follow my Mastodon account at <a rel="me" href="https://techhub.social/@scouten">@scouten@techhub.social</a>.

I hope you enjoy following along.
