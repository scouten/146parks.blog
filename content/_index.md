**Hi, Iâ€™m Eric.** I'm a photographer and software developer living near Seattle, Washington.

I enjoy traveling worldwide and often blog about my travels on my main site, [ericscouten.com](https://ericscouten.com).

**146 Parks** is a photography and blogging project designed for these times when we need to stay closer to home. By my count, my home state of Washington has 146 state parks. I intend to visit, enjoy, and document them all.

I hope you enjoy following along.

(P.S. Enjoy maps? Here's [one showing where these parks are located](/map).)
