**146 Parks** is a photography and blogging project that I started in 2020 so I could continue exploring while long-distance travel was not viable. Though bigger travel is once again an option, I intend to visit, enjoy, and document all of Washington's state parks.

There's a handy [map](/map) of parks I've visited. Or they're listed below with the most-recently visited parks first.
