**Hi, I’m Eric.** I'm a photographer and software developer living near Seattle, Washington.

I enjoy traveling worldwide and often blog about my travels on my main travel site, [ericscouten.travel](https://ericscouten.travel).

**146 Parks** is a photography and blogging project that I started in 2020 so I could continue exploring while long-distance travel was not viable. Though bigger travel is once again an option, I intend to visit, enjoy, and document all of Washington's state parks.

I hope you enjoy following along.
