Miles of boulders to climb over? Miles of man-eating potholes to drive through? One of the most difficult hikes in the State Park system? Sure! Sign me up!

Mount Pilchuck is a difficult hike (just over five miles round trip, 2300’ elevation gain), but oh so worth it.

**A word to the wise:** This often confuses people, but the parking lot for this hike is on National Forest property, which means you need a National Forest parking pass (or an intergovernmental pass such as the _America the Beautiful_ pass) to park here, **not** the state Discover Pass.

The actual entrance to the park is about a quarter of a mile's hike past the parking lot.

I have questions about the structural integrity of this tree:

As you climb up and out of the forest, the views become increasingly inspiring:

{{ es_image(id="es-4236-117") }}
{{ es_image(id="es-4236-108", caption="The lookout tower.") }}

When we got to the very top (5300’ or a mile in altitude), my knees were giving me the stink eye. I paid attention and opted out of the final scramble up the rocks to the lookout tower, so sadly I have no photos to share of that occasion.
