For my first park of the new year, I went to the coast on a sunny Sunday afternoon. Ocean City State Park is nestled in an unassuming part of the coast just north of the city for which it is named.

There are campsites (many of which were either flooded or closed for the season) and a lot of sandy beach.

Getting _to_ this beach in the rainy season can mean getting your boots wet. This first creekbed is also the main hiking trail into the beach.
