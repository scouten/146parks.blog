Sadly, the lake for which this park is named is no longer the chief attraction. A long-running algae bloom has made the lake water unsafe for most animals, including humans, to touch, so boating, swimming, and the like are now off limits.

Here are a few views of the lake from a safe distance:

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4224-017", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4224-017") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4224-019", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4224-019") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4224-021", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4224-021") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4224-014", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4224-014") }}

What you _can_ do is hike through the forest _around_ the lake, and that is what I did on this June morning:

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4224-023", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4224-023") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4224-027", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4224-027") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4224-028", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4224-028") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4224-031", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4224-031") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4224-036", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4224-036") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4224-039", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4224-039") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4224-042", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4224-042") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4224-045", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4224-045") }}
