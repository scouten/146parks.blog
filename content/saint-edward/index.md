For decades, Saint Edward was the Northwest's preeminent Catholic seminary. It closed in 1976 and shortly thereafter became a state park.

<!-- more -->

The former seminary building has recently reopened as a hotel with restaurants and bars. (Sadly, I was short on time when I visited this park so I did not step inside, but the web site makes it look charming.)

From the main parking lot, there are several hiking trails that can lead you down the 300-foot slope to Lake Washington.
