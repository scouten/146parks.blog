Who would know this was once a gravel pit? Today, this park is an examplar of wetland restoration, teeming with all manner of birds, beavers, and other wildlife in the midst of the city. A large network of hiking trails winds its way through forest, marsh, ponds, and the Yakima River itself.

So ... those signs that keep telling you "this way back to the park?" Yeah, you're gonna want to observe those ...

... because pretty soon the trail starts getting really sketchy:

And then you're staring down a deer because there aren't any more humans on the trail.

But if you _do_ continue past the deer, you do get a nice view of the Yakima River. What you don't get is a way back to the main park, except by backtracking.
