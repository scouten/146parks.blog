This small state park commemorates the life of Ranald MacDonald, a 19th-century pioneer and explorer.

<!-- more -->

MacDonald gave up a life in banking to explore and set out to visit Japan. He landed in Japan in 1848 at a time when foreigners were strictly disallowed from visiting the country. During his time in prison, he taught English to some of his captors and was eventually allowed to return to the US.

He passed away while visiting his neice in Washington state in 1894. The family's grave site where he was buried is on a hillside near the Canadian boarder and is now maintained as a state park.
