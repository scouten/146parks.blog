Ike Kinswa is the quintessential summer camp-and-swim park. It's open year-round, so, of course, I visited in the midst of winter. I was fortunate to have sunny weather and a relatively quiet place to visit.

This park offers several cabins for rent. I happened to show up at just the right moment and the staff kindly let me take a look around one cabin while they were cleaning between guests:
