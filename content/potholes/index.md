Who names a park after everyone’s “favorite” road misfeature? Sorry. I couldn’t resist. Actually, it’s not named for that. The park is named for the unique landforms created in the Ice Age, in which the land itself appeared much like a pitted road. Now flooded as part of the O’Sullivan Reservoir, these depressions form myriad small lakes that are a favorite of fisherman and birders.

I wasn’t able to explore those lakes on my visit, but I did get a chance to enjoy the camping grounds and trails of Potholes State Park.

Inland a bit from the camping area there is a trail along an unnamed creek.
