Pleasant Harbor is a small state park. It looks like it's mostly intended for boaters looking for a place to stay for a night or two.

On nearby US 101, there's no signage to point to this park. With a little guesswork (and a well-informed maps app), I was able to find the parking lot and walk out onto the park's dock and take a few pictures.

The adjacent marina would _really_ like you to know what's state park and what's private marina.
