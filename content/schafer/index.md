One year ago today, I took the ferry to Lopez Island and started this project by making a few photos in [Spencer Spit State Park](../spencer-spit). Today's park, Schafer, offers a walk along the Satsop River and some fall colors.

I've recently learned that the concept of an exact count of Washington's state parks is a bit controversial. There are parks within parks, little parks, big parks ... what do you count? The official parks site only says "more than 120" parks. I've seen some counts over 150.

So, I don't know. Maybe I don't have the exact count either, but ... let's assume for the moment that 146 is accurate. If so, I made it halfway to my goal of all of the parks. Hope you've enjoyed following along as much as I've enjoyed visiting and blogging about the parks.
