Located near the Canadian border, this park seems fairly basic on the surface. Dig a little deeper (i.e. arrange a tour at the right time) and you'll find some views unlike any other of Washington's state parks.

A visit to Crawford State Park starts off with a simple-enough hiking trail ...

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4390-222", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/07/es-4390-222") }}

But then you are confronted with this mysterious gate surrounding some steps down into the ground:

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4390-226", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/07/es-4390-226") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4390-228", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/07/es-4390-228") }}

Fortunately, I had arranged for just such a tour. The tour explores roughly 1/3 of a mile underground in a cave first discovered around the beginning of the previous century. There are walkways and lights throughout the cave which make it easy to see the various limestone formations.

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4390-241", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/07/es-4390-241") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4390-245", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/07/es-4390-245") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4390-259", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/07/es-4390-259") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4390-270", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/07/es-4390-270") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4390-295", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/07/es-4390-295") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4390-297", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/07/es-4390-297") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4390-304", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/07/es-4390-304") }}

A highlight of the tour was at the end of the walkway. Our tour guide turned off the lights and turned on (I think ... if I remember correctly) ultraviolet lights, which lit up some of the rock formations above us in this other-worldly fashion:

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4390-310", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/07/es-4390-310") }}

When nobody talks in the cave, it is incredibly quiet in there.

{{ es_vimeo(id="es-4390-316" vmid="758154342") }}

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4390-319", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/07/es-4390-319") }}

There's also a hiking trail north of the cave which leads to this picnic table with a rather unusual view:

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4390-329", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/07/es-4390-329") }}

Okay, the view isn't all that, but ... notice that sign in the background?

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4390-327", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/07/es-4390-327") }}

I did mention this park was _near_ the Canadian border. Yeah, it's _that_ near the border. (For the record, I did not pass the sign.)
