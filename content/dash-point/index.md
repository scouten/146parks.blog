The official description of this park says that the highlight is the beach. But, for me, it was the miles and miles of hiking trails.

After a brief stop at the beach, I hiked a 5-mile loop through the woods behind the main entrance to this park. Judging by the number of people I saw on this cool but sunny December afternoon, these are very popular trails.

I learned, after coming down the hill, that this was named Heart Attack Hill. Feeling thankful that I wound up hiking _down_ this trail, not up it.
