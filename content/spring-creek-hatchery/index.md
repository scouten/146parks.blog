At first glance, this might look like an ordinary riverside scenic park. And, yes, it is that. Look a little deeper. Notice the wind. Notice the mountains nearby. Squint a little bit and watch the river. See those waves?

Right!

That's the fun of this park.

This is a haven for wind- and kite-surfers.

I don't happen to be a kite-surfer, but it's a lot of fun to watch.

Sorry for the wind noise in this video, but it should at least give you an idea of the speed and fun of this sport ...
