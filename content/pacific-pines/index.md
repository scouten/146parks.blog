Midway along the Long Beach Peninsula, Pacific Pines State Park offers access to the long, sandy beaches that typify southwest Washington's coast.

This is a simple and small (10 acre) park. From the parking lot, there's a short trail through a forest. The woods give way after a couple minutes to sand dunes and then the beach.

We visited on a blustery day and found a few other beach explorers and one intrepid fisherman in his hip-waders.
