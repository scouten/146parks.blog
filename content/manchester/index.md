Manchester State Park is one of many that are built on former military grounds in the Puget Sound region. It offers a nice combination of abandoned buildings, forested trails, camping, and waterfront views.

Once upon a time, a train came to Manchester. It's hard to imagine it now as the tracks and even the rail grade are long gone, but the former station remains, now used as a picnic shelter and event pavilion. A good friend of mine was married here; she encouraged me to go looking for it when I explored this park.

This site will mostly be a color photoblog, but I couldn't resist getting out my [trusty infrared camera](https://www.ericscouten.com/articles/mirrorless-infrared/) to shoot one of the old train station:
