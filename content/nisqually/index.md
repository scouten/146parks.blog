This is a quiet and modest park -- officially titled as "under development," butthere are some good hikes to be had here.

I visited on a gray and rainy day (shocker ... this is winter in western Washington!) and found some good trails and a nice view of the Mashel River right before it joins the Nisqually River.

On a sunnier day, I think there might have been some nice views of nearby Mount Rainier as well.

Perhaps they are preparing to do more trail development here?

After a very rainy season, the river is running very fast!
