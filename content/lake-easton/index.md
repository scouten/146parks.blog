The day I visited Lake Easton State Park was a chilly and snowy day, and yet the park and its forests, trails, and views offered me a warm welcome.

This road geek enjoys the opportunity to explore the stretch of the old US Highway 10, with a bridge built in 1927 which is no longer open to vehicle traffic. Highway 10 has since been superseded by the adjacent Interstate 90, which casts a rather loud shadow over the entire park.

Lake Easton is a convenient stopping place for those following the Palouse to Cascades State Park Trail (until recently known as Iron Horse State Park).
