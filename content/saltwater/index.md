Saltwater State Park lies right in the heart of the metropolis that is Seattle, Tacoma, and the many cities in between. The shallow tidelands appeal to divers and clam diggers and the rest of us who just like to explore a less-altered shoreline.

The park's location a few miles south of our primary airport means that any visit is frequently punctuated by the sound of jetliners hauling themselves into the sky or preparing for their imminent arrival -- a noisy ordeal either way.

There is also a small network of trails in the forests and hills behind the shoreline:
