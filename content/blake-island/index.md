Blake Island Marine State Park is a popular island boating destination near my home. I've lived in this area for nearly two decades and not managed to visit it before this year. On the April day that I visited, there were people from all kinds of watercraft visiting: kayaks, sailboats, motorboats, and the Argosy tourist boat from Seattle.

I chose to kayak over from nearby Manchester.

There are several miles of hiking trails on the island. Once you step away from the north perimeter trail and the Tillicum Village area, it's very quiet. I didn't see another person for an hour or so on these trails:
