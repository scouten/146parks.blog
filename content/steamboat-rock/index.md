There is only one Steamboat Rock. As a 600-foot tall basalt rock formation in an otherwise mostly-level landscape, it is no wonder it made an impression on early explorers.

I visited this park at the end of the winter season and captured a few frames before an approaching snowstorm caused me to cut my hike short and change my plans.

When I came back in the summer, I found lush greens and a busy campground.

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4390-109", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/07/es-4390-109") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4390-121", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/07/es-4390-121") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4390-125", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/07/es-4390-125") }}

I set out to hike up the Rock, at least to the best of my ability:

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4390-133", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/07/es-4390-133") }}

I only made it partway up, but the views, even there, were impressive:

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4390-139p", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/07/es-4390-139p") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4390-189", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/07/es-4390-189") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4390-194", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/07/es-4390-194") }}

As I left for my next destination, I caught a couple more views of the Rock and a waterskier from Highway 155:

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4390-212", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/07/es-4390-212") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4390-215", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/07/es-4390-215") }}
