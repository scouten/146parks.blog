There is only one Steamboat Rock. As a 600-foot tall basalt rock formation in an otherwise mostly-level landscape, it is no wonder it made an impression on early explorers.

I visited this park at the end of the winter season and captured a few frames before an approaching snowstorm caused me to cut my hike short and change my plans.

When I came back in the summer, I found lush greens and a busy campground.

I set out to hike up the Rock, at least to the best of my ability:

I only made it partway up, but the views, even there, were impressive:

As I left for my next destination, I caught a couple more views of the Rock and a waterskier from Highway 155:
