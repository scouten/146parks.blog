Washington's coastline is often characterized as blustery. When I visited Westport Light State Park recently, that was definitely the case.

I dodged a rainstorm, but just barely.

There's a long trail just inland from the beach. Here are some samples of the view from the bluffs.

There are also some trails through the woods behind the bluffs. From what I could tell they're mostly used by cyclists.

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4328-043", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/04/es-4328-043") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4328-046", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/04/es-4328-046") }}

And the irony of this park? The lighthouse for which it is named ... is not actually in the park. It's also probably the only lighthouse that is almost a mile inland. (The land west of the lighthouse filled in by natural processes over the century or so since the lighthouse was constructed.)
