Rainbow Falls State Park offers a moment to enjoy the sounds of rushing water along the Chehalis River or a longer rest camping among the tall trees of an of old-growth forest.

Take a short hike along the river and into the forest:

{{ es_vimeo(id="es-4135-018" vmid="552717777") }}

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4135-009", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2020/10/es-4135-009") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4135-023", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2020/10/es-4135-023") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4135-027", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2020/10/es-4135-027") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4135-031", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2020/10/es-4135-031") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4135-033", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2020/10/es-4135-033") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4135-035", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2020/10/es-4135-035") }}

Camp among the tall trees. And maybe help somebodyâ€™s toy car get back home:

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4135-039", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2020/10/es-4135-039") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4135-040", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2020/10/es-4135-040") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4135-042", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2020/10/es-4135-042") }}
