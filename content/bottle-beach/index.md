Bottle Beach State Park offers more than a mile of pristine shoreline on the south shore of Grays Harbor. Known mostly for birding, this park was delightfully quiet when I visited on a gray January afternoon.

The first part of the park trail takes you through a marsh and over Redman Slough on your way to the beach itself.

Once past the slough, youâ€™re on the beach. I walked most of the length of the beach and had it entirely to myself for most of an hour, except for the swarms of birds enjoying the shallow waters.

As I was leaving, I was greeted by two birders who asked if I had seen any eagles.

I had.
