As I've written [before on this site](/parks/jackson-house/), I find commemorations of white man's "victory" over native peoples challenging to talk about. Even though this particular battle is considered a victory for the native side, we all know how this drama ultimately played out.

But, anyhow, here we are, commemerating a battlefield. And, by the way, there's still a beautiful landscape nearby.
