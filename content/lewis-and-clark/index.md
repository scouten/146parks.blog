Need a quiet walk in the woods? Lewis and Clark is your place. Though this is ostensibly a horse-friendly park, I encountered none in my tour.

I had relatively little time, so I did a quick hike through some of the trails in this park.

Someday perhaps I will return to explore the campgrounds and other recreation areas.
