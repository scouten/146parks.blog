Some 217 years ago, Captains Lewis and Clark supposedly spent the night in this location on their way home from the Pacific Ocean. You can, too, though it might not be _quite_ as noteworthy.

I'm on a [larger road trip](https://ericscouten.travel/2023/06-20+summer-break/) and this park, conveniently located along US 12 in eastern Washington, offered a nice place to get out and stretch my legs.

There are a few short trails around the grounds, which mostly offer views of the surrounding farmsteads.

The park's web site and numerous signs around the park warned of cottonwood fluff being everywhere. They weren't kidding.

There are a couple of peek-a-boo views of the Touchet River from one of the trails.
