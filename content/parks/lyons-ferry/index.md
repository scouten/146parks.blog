Once upon a time, there was a ferry here. It's long since been superceded by a bridge which is surprisingly narrow by today's standards. Lyons Ferry State Park offers a view of the abandoned historic ferry and expansive views of the Snake and Palouse Rivers.

I visited on a spring weekend and found the park delightfully quiet.

Sometime long ago, somebody decided -- at what must have been great expense -- to build a pier out to an island in the middle of the river. Whatever purpose that served has long since passed, but the walkway remains as a hiking trail that I enjoyed:

As for the historic ferry, there was lots of signage such as this warning visitors to stay away from the structure itself:

If this is the ferry, I'm not inclined to doubt them:
