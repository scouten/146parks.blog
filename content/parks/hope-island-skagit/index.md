Hope Island State Park is a well-traveled marine state park. When I visited, there were several sailboats anchored just off the island to the north, several other kayakers, and a few people who motored right up onto the shore for a picnic on the beach.

I approached from the north, having just visited [Skagit Island State Park](/parks/skagit-island/). Here is the first clear view of Hope Island:

I circled around the island to the east. I do not recommend following my path unless you are a strong paddler. The currents along the southeast corner of the island are very strong; I managed to get through, but it wasn't easy.

I found a landing site on the south side of the island and enjoyed the sun for a bit before continuing my route around the island.

I eventually circled around to the north side of the island and found the landing site that is most commonly used. From there, I found a hiking trail that led to a nice view south over the Island.

_About the parenthesis on the title:_ There is another state park named Hope Island in the southern Puget Sound that I [visited earlier this year](/parks/hope-island-mason/).
