Situated at the tip of Long Beach Peninsula, Leadbetter Point State Park offers an excellent opportunity to get away from it all by clamming, birdwatching, or just enjoying the unending thunder of the ocean trying to climb up onto the dunes.

From the main parking lot, you can hike the Weather Beach Trail (about a mile) through the forest and dunes and find yourself on a long sandy beach, which you may have almost entirely to yourself.

Social distancing? Sure, no problem!

Most of the footprints on the beach are not human.
