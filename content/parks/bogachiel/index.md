Bogachiel is Washingtonâ€™s sole state park on the outer reaches of the Olympic Peninsula. Situated on the banks of the Bogachiel River south of Forks, it offers camping and some short hiking trails. On this rainy winter day, it offered solitude, too. I had the park more or less to myself for much of an afternoon.

I expect, were I to return in mid-summer, I would find it very much busier. Meanwhile the campground and the river quietly await the return of the crowds and campers.

There is a short hiking trail through the woods near the river and many more hiking trails in the area. Here are a few scenes from within the park itself.
