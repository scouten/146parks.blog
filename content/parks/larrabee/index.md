Washingtonâ€™s first state park started in 1915 as a small waterfront park donated by Charles Larrabee, a prominent Bellingham businessman and philanthropist. It has since grown to a large forest preserve with many miles of hiking trails.

A friend and I hiked some of these trails on a cool fall afternoon, starting from the main parking lot and trailhead and heading up to Fragrance Lake and ultimately to the Cyrus Gates Overlook. The trail is mostly forested and a moderate climb (approximately 2000 feet of elevation gain).

At the end of the hike, I took a moment to walk down to the beach and enjoy the hint of a sunset over the ocean.
