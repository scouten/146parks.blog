Battle Ground Lake State Park is a quiet retreat from the busy-ness that surrounds the Portland/Vancouver metropolis. Camp, hike, ride your horse, fish, … whatever it is that helps you relax, you can do it here.

I spent a couple hours hiking on the trails that surround the park’s namesake lake and barely saw another soul, aside from a few people riding their horses.

Not a bad way to welcome in the new year.

Some day I shall have to return to check out the rental cabins.
