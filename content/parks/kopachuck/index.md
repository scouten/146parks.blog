Kopachuck was once a popular camping park. It has since become a day-use park with some nice hiking trails and beach access. I visited on a blustery winter day and found myself wishing I, too, had brought a dog to walk in the park.

Kopachuck offers a tease of nearby Cutts Island State Park. As the name implies, that park is an island, a mile or so away across Carr Inlet. I did not have my kayak with me that day, so that visit will be the subject of a future article. Stay tuned â€¦

Looking for a quick day hike? Kopachuck offers some nice wooded, inland trails.

But, do be careful, especially in the area of the former campground. In the early 2010s, forestry officials determined that many of the trees in the area had been infected with laminated root rot, which compromises the root structure and makes the trees more likely to drop large branches or fall entirely. The old campground access roads have become hiking trails.
