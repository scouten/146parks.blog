You might be forgiven for thinking that this isn’t really a full-fledged state park. From the official description, the park isn’t developed yet due to lack of funding. But, if you are looking for a great place to hike, missing this park would be a big oversight. You should go.

This supposedly “undeveloped” park actually offers miles of well-groomed and well-marked hiking and biking trails. When I visited (admittedly on a cold December morning), they were little used.

That said, somebody did take the time to decorate one of the trails in Christmas style:

It takes a few miles of hiking to get there, but the park offers a quiet beach with very quiet access to and views of the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

After spending some quiet time on the beach, I hiked two hours to get back to my car.

I didn’t see another person the entire time.

**A funny story about this park and the 146 Parks site:** A month or so after I had launched this site (which included counting the parks, registering the domain, and building the logo, among other things), I discovered that I had entered one of the parks twice in my inventory of the parks.

If so, that would mean there would only be _145_ parks.

Awkward!

And then, while on my way to visit Dungeness Spit (also a worthy hike, though not a state park), I drove past a sign pointing to “Miller Peninsula State Park Property.” Hmmm. I had -- as my introduction above suggested -- overlooked this park, thinking it was not really a park yet. I made a mental note to reconsider. Further research showed that it was, in fact, worth visiting.

So now, once again, I believe there are 146 state parks in Washington. I look forward to visiting and documenting the remaining 135 of them.
