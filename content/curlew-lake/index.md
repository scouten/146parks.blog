Curlew Lake is a quiet lake-and-campground park tucked away in the hills of northeastern Washington.

We visited on a summer afternoon and found it popular with a wide variety of boaters, swimmers, and campers.

There's a small network of trails within the park and along the lake.

Even on this weekend, just ahead of the July 4th holiday, there were plenty of campers around.

The landscape on the east side of the park is a bit unusual in that Ferry County has built its regional airport between the park and State Highway 21.
