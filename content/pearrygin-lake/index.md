This park is located in the foothills of the North Cascade mountain range near the old-West themed village of Winthrop. There's plenty to do here on the water, in the campgrounds, or on its several miles of hiking trails.

I set forth on the Rex Derr hiking trail, dedicated in memory of a former director of the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission. This feathered friend was my hiking companion for quite a while along the trail:

My route wound up taking me about three miles through the hills above the lake.
