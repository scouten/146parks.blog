Tucked into the mountains a half hour's drive from Lake Chelan, Alta Lake is a summer getaway with a large campground, swimming beach, and excellent mountain views.

I showed up in the morning of one of our hottest summer days and found people already soaking in the cool lake breeze.

The park was damaged in a forest fire in 2014, but much of the vegetation has regrown since then.
