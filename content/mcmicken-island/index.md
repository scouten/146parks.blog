Getting to McMicken Island is half the fun! Once there, you'll find a quiet island getaway popular with other boaters.

I put in from nearby [Joemma Beach State Park](../joemma-beach), which made for a trip of about three miles each way.

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4237-024", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/07/es-4237-024") }}

There were what seemed like a lot of jellyfish along the way:

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4237-036", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/07/es-4237-036") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4237-030p", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/07/es-4237-030p") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4237-046", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/07/es-4237-046") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4237-058", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/07/es-4237-058") }}

Once on the island, there were a few short hiking trails.

An odd feature of this park is that it does not encompass the entire island. A small section of the island is privately owned. The state does not allow camping in the park; the tents you see are located on the private portion of the island.

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4237-059p", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/07/es-4237-059p") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4237-083", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/07/es-4237-083") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4237-087", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/07/es-4237-087") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4237-088", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/07/es-4237-088") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4237-089", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/07/es-4237-089") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4237-091", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/07/es-4237-091") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4237-117", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/07/es-4237-117") }}

Conversely, a part of the park is _not_ located on the island, but rather on the "mainland" of Harstine Island, a short distance to the west.

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4237-127", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/07/es-4237-127") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4237-123", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/07/es-4237-123") }}
