Back in the Ice Age, floods carved dramatic canyons out of the bedrock and left waterfalls much larger than Niagara Falls behind. Today, those falls have dried up but the scenery remains.

I first visited this park at the end of winter and was taken by its other-worldly landscape.

Much of the park was closed for the winter season, so I knew I had to plan another visit. That happened this summer and I found a very much busier and vibrant park this time.

I walked a fair amount of the old Park Lake Road, which is now closed to vehicular traffic, but open for hiking.

I then turned east and explored the Deep Lake Trail. A few people were out then, and I found myself a bit envious of the person who had thought to bring their kayak.

And finally, I drove the desolate and dusty road to Dry Falls Lake.
