This is a park for those with small, beachable watercraft. Like me! I loaded up my kayak and paddled from nearby Indian Island to Kinney Point on a mild spring day. I was treated to a very quiet day on the water and in the woods.

Kinney Point State Park is part of Marrowstone Island, which you can drive to. There are two other state parks on the island, which I've previously visited: [Fort Flagler](../fort-flagler) and [Mystery Bay](../mystery-bay).

This one is different, though. Kinney Point is surrounded by private property, so there is no access by road.

Conveniently, they do offer a parking ramp for visitors:

There is a short hiking trail (maybe a mile at most?) through the park. I never saw another person the entire time.
