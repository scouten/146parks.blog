Like Fort Worden, which [I visited recently](/fort-worden), Fort Casey was built as part of our coastal defense system at the turn of the last century.

<!-- more -->

After World War II, the fort was no longer needed and so it was turned over to the state for use as a park. Today, we can all explore the gun batteries and even a couple of 16-inch guns. They are not original to this fort, but are contemporary of the era.

I visited near sunset, which added fun color and shadow to the scenes.

Fort Casey's grounds also include the Admiralty Head Lighthouse.

A funny story about this next photo, with which I'll close this post: As I was walking back from the lighthouse, I spotted this confluence of Mount Rainier and the cannon. I spent a good 10 or 15 minutes experimenting with angles and hoping against hope that the area would eventually be clear of other park visitors.

It happened once, briefly. I got the shot I thought I wanted. But when I came back to review my work later, I found it kind of boring.

Instead I'm sharing the exact photo I had been working so hard to _avoid_ -- a photo with people in it. I especially enjoyed this one of a couple and their dogs contemplating the cannon. Hope you enjoy it too!
