Bay View State Park borders the Padilla Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, where marine biologists and other scientists study the plants and animals that call this bay home.

This park is probably best known as a camping park, but I chose instead to make a short day trip of it.

I'll likely be back later in the summer, as it looks like an ideal launching point for one of the nearby island state parks.

Across the bay are the major oil refineries serving Washington and Oregon.
