Looking for a quiet place to camp, enjoy the sunrise, or set out for a morning fishing run? Maryhill is your spot.

<!-- more -->

Some areas of the park were shut down for the season when I visited, but there's still a soft murmur of activity from campers and fishers.

Looking east from the park across the Columbia River to Mount Hood ...

I first visited on a Saturday afternoon and realized that the real potential for good photos from this park would be the next morning at sunrise. And it was!
