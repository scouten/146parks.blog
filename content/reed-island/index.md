Reed Island State Park is, as the name might suggest, an island park. It's a bit east of Portland/Vancouver in a surprisingly quiet part of the Columbia River.

Sadly, my track log for this trip is lost to a software bug, but I put in from [Captain William Clark Regional Park](https://clark.wa.gov/public-works/captain-william-clark-regional-park-cottonwood-beach) and kayaked across the river to Reed Island.

The [official description](https://parks.state.wa.us/572/Reed-Island) of the park says that the island is "ringed by a sandy beach." That was not my experience. I suspect the river level was higher than normal, as most of the island was ringed by flooded forests and grassy marshes.

Had I known that this small slice of the island on the northeast corner was the only sandy beach on the island, I would have gone ashore there:

Instead, I wound up circumnavigating the island in my kayak, which was a delightful trip in itself.
