There’s really no mystery regarding what Mystery Bay State Park is about: It’s about being lazy and relaxing. BYOB is recommended (Bring Your Own Boat).  But even if you come without a boat (as I did), it’s a delightful place to disconnect and enjoy the water and the views.

Located on the west shore of Marrowstone Island, Mystery Bay offers a place to relax, have a picnic, contemplate the sunset, enjoy the sounds of water lapping on the shore, and explore the nearby waters.
