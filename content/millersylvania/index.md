Millersylvania, on the shores of Deep Lake south of Olympia, is a great place for relaxing and maybe a light hike.

I visited the park on our national holiday, the Fourth of July, as people were breathing a collective sigh of relief about the (supposed) end of the pandemic and starting to feel more comfortable celebrating again.

The park was filled with families picnicing, sunbathing, and enjoying the water. It was nice to see.

I started to hike some of the trails into the woods behind the lake, but …
