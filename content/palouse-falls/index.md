This park is pretty much what it says on the tin: an epic waterfall in the middle of the rolling hills and grasslands of the Palouse in eastern Washington.

If you've read my other park pages, you've probably noticed that I avoid showing the same scene multiple times.

That's ... rather more difficult to avoid here, as the park offers several different views of the falls and not that much more.

Here we see the Palouse River after going through the falls:

There is a small network of hiking trails. We are told they are _very dangerous,_ but assuming you are wise enough to stay back from the edge, they offer a view of the Palouse before the falls:

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4183-070", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/03/es-4183-070") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4183-072", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/03/es-4183-072") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4183-074", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/03/es-4183-074") }}

Every so often, while observing the falls, the rumbling gets a bit louder for a few minutes. I didn't manage to see a train on these tracks, but I presume this is the source. (Impressive excavation effort, right?)
