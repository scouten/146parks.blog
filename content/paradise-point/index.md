At first glance,  this park doesn't quite seem like "paradise." If you don't get out of your car, all you'll see is a disc golf course with a six-lane freeway running above it. It's pretty noisy, as you might imagine. 

<!-- more -->

But don't stop there. That would miss the back-story of this park. You can hike back along the east fork of the Lewis River and quickly lose the commotion of the freeway. In less than a mile, you're in a completely different and very quiet world.

It's worth doing.
