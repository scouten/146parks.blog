One _might_ think that with a name like Seaquest, that you would find this park near the ocean or at least on some sort of route _to_ the ocean.

Not so.

This park is inland, on the road to Mount Saint Helens. ([Mount Saint Helens Visitor Center](/mount-saint-helens/), just across the road, offers some great views across Silver Lake to the mountain, some 30 miles to the east.)

No, the park is named for Charles John Seaquest, a Swedish immigrant who settled in the area circa 1870. His family left the property to the state for use as a park in the 1930s.

I drove in and thought for a while that this park offered only a campground and some picnic grounds, as shown here ...

I was starting to fear that this might be a relatively boring park post. Indeed, I met somebody else, visiting from out of state, who was looking for hiking trails. No idea if she ever found the trails, but ...

I _did_ notice a worn, but unmarked, path leading out of one side of a parking lot.

It turns out that there is a nice network of trails here and -- aside from the lack of signage from the campground/picnic area -- they are quite well maintained and documented:

Being here in late May, the forest was full of lush green foliage. I did a roughly 3 mile / 5 km hike through this forest. It was delightfully quiet; I never saw anyone else the entire time.
