Olallie is one of our largest state parks, with many trails to explore a short drive outside of Seattle. I hiked the Cedar Butte trail with a friend on a gray and slightly rainy day.

The first part of this hike is on the Palouse to Cascade State Park Trail, which will probably be a project for next summer.

We stopped along the trail for a view of Boxley Creek. The old railroad bridge gives a nice view of the creek and a small waterfall:

The turnoff for the Cedar Butte trail is ... shall we say ... subtle? We almost missed it.

And, behold, the (foggy) view from the top of Cedar Butte!
