Doug's Beach is named for Doug Campbell, who was an early pioneer of windsurfing. The park is popular today for that sport, but there were none at the time I visited. (Indeed, there were no other visitors to the park at all while I was there.)

See [Spring Creek Hatchery](/spring-creek-hatchery) where I did get some great photos and videos of windsurfing a year or so ago.
