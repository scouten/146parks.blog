Situated on the west shore of Whidbey Island west of Oak Harbor, Joseph Whidbey State Park offers a few miles of hiking trails through forest and wetlands and a long sandy beach.

I'm told it is a great place for storm watching, but on the late spring day when I visited, there were little more than puffy clouds in the sky to see.

I started with the hiking trails and found my way to the beach later.

With the rainy spring we've had, some of the trails got pretty muddy:
