Located on the Hood Canal, several miles west of Silverdale, Scenic Beach State Park offers hiking trails, camping, and ... ah, yes ... a beach!

One of the fun attractions in this park is the Emel House, built in 1912, and now used for private events (weddings, etc.) and for local community organization meetings. It's intriguing to imagine the view when this was a truly remote location.

The house wasn't open when I visited the park, but I caught a few nice pictures through the windows.

There are a few miles of hiking trails in this park. Aside from the occasional jogger, they were mostly deserted during my time here.

Oh yes, the name of this park _did_ include "Beach," didn't it?

Here is the view from said beach, looking roughly in the direction of Dosewallips State Park, which [I visited almost a year ago](../dosewallips) as part of this project.
