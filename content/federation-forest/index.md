Nestled along the shores of the White River east of Enumclaw is a rare patch of Washington's old-growth forest, set aside due to the persistent work of the General Federation of Women's Clubs in Washington. For that reason, it was given the name of Federation Forest State Park when it was established in 1949.

This wasn't their first attempt to save an old-growth forest. In the 1920s a similar effort was made and led to the establishment of the first Federation Forest State Park near Snoqualmie Pass, but that effort succumbed to logging, fire, and wind and was closed a decade later.

Today's park offers several miles of hiking trails (which I wound up having almost entirely to myself, due to the gloomy weather) and a mile or two of raw White River shoreline.
