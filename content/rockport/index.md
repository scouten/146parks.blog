Hike through a rare old-growth forest in Washington State? Sure! That is what Rockport State Park offers you.

The three-mile-long Evergreen Loop Trail is a gentle and well-maintained trail with a nice variety of forest experiences. Here's what caught my eye on my hike of that trail:

Sadly, the campground is now permanently closed due the risk posed by diseased trees.
