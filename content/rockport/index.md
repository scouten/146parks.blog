Hike through a rare old-growth forest in Washington State? Sure! That is what Rockport State Park offers you.

The three-mile-long Evergreen Loop Trail is a gentle and well-maintained trail with a nice variety of forest experiences. Here's what caught my eye on my hike of that trail:

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4222-073", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4222-073") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4222-075", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4222-075") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4222-076", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4222-076") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4222-077", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4222-077") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4222-080", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4222-080") }}

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4222-081", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4222-081", caption="Labeled the “Broken Fir,” this tree lived from 1660 to 1974.") }}

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4222-085", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4222-085") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4222-087", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4222-087") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4222-089", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4222-089") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4222-091", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4222-091") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4222-095", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4222-095") }}

{{ es_vimeo(id="es-4222-096" vmid="573824616") }}

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4222-099", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4222-099") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4222-104", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2021/06/es-4222-104") }}

Sadly, the campground is now permanently closed due the risk posed by diseased trees.
