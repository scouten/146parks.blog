I learned about this "park" only a few weeks ago. I knew that I would have to add it to this site, and that doing so would be uncomfortable.

Let's start with the elephant in the room.

I'm a white person. This monument commemorates the forceful taking of large parts of what we now call eastern Washington from the native peoples -- the Palouse, Nez Perce, and others -- who had lived here for time immemorial.

By people who look like me.

I contemplated not adding this "park" to my site. But ... it _is_ technically part of the state parks system and I don't think we should avoid or run away from our history. Neither should we celebrate or be comfortable with it.

Fellow state parks quester Lauren Danner [wrote eloquently about this park](https://laurendanner.com/spokane-plains-battlefield-state-park/) on her blog and I encourage you to read her retelling of the history of this site.

If there's any good news to be found here, it's that the Washington State Historical Society [has pledged to revisit monuments](https://www.washingtonhistory.org/across-washington/monuments-project/) -- including this one -- that were placed decades ago and that present a culturally incomplete version of our mutual history.

I look forward to that update.

Meanwhile, this monument is a dismal rock pyramid that sits in a dreary field. There is no road signage announcing its presence and no listing on the state parks web site.

That's probably for the best.
