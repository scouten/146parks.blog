What makes Cama Beach State Park distinctive is its well-preserved family cabins dating back to the 1930s.

When the owners of the Cama Beach family beach resort decided to close in 1989, they approached the state with the idea of transforming it into a state park. Some years later, that vision came to pass, and the park feels much like a trip down memory lane.

I wasn't able to enter any of the cabins while there, but I could press my camera up against the glass for a good view inside.

There are also a few miles of hiking trails in the hills above the park, but those I'll save for another time.
