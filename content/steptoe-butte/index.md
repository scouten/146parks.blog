Steptoe Butte is a geographic anomaly: a deposit of quartzite that has resisted the nature's attempts to wash it away. Today it sits a thousand feet above the surrounding landscape and offers panoramic views of the Palouse hills.

**2021 visitors please note:** Check locally before going to the park. The State Parks web site states that there will be a project to rebuild the park's access road, leading to a complete closure of the park for 3-4 months this summer. The start of the project had been delayed at the time I visited, so I was able to proceed; they did not offer a new start date when I enquired.

With slopes like these, I wouldn't want to try this in winter, either.
