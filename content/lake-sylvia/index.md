To honor our nation's birthday and to get outside for a bit, my daughter and I brought our kayak and explored Lake Sylvia.

<!-- more -->

The lake is a small and easy paddle; neither of us had been kayaking much this year so it was a nice re-introduction to the sport.

The park was, of course, busy with campers and sun-lovers out enjoying the holiday.

Lake Sylvia was formed by a dam built in 1909 and for a few decades thereafter provided power and drinking water for the city of Montesano.

This scene, captured from the hiking trail along the west shore of the lake, gave me some serious deep South vibes. (I spent quite a bit of time in the [Deep South](https://ericscouten.travel/2023/03-18+southeastern-us/) earlier this year.)
