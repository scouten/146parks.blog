This morning I visited Wanapum Recreation Area on the shores of the Columbia River.

<!-- more -->

I arrived at sunrise, thinking that the sun would lend extra color and vibrance to the scenery. It did.

The site offers about 50 tent and RV camp sites nestled amongst trees along the river. So as not to disturb anyone, I took my photo of the campground from the highway above.

Once in Wanapum, I walked around the picnic grounds and beaches, which I had almost entirely to myself.

You might notice it's a bit hazy. There are some forest fires around today. Later during the day, it became much more obvious.

## See You in Spring 2025!

This will likely be my last park visit for 2024. There are relatively few parks remaining and most of them are bike trails or islands which will be easier or more comfortable to visit during the warmer months next year.

I encourage you to <a href="#subscribe">subscribe to my mailing list</a> to follow along on [my other travels](https://ericscouten.travel) and catch up when the park-visiting resumes next spring!

See you soon!
