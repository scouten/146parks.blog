Spokane is blessed to have a nearly 40-mile bike trail as part of the state parks system. The trail mostly follows the Spokane River from the state line with Idaho to the Nine Mile Recreation Area.

<!-- more -->

I had most of an afternoon today to explore the trail. I rented an e-bike from the good folks at [The Bike Hub](https://thebikehub.com/pages/bicycle-rentals). Given the time available, that allowed me to explore a few segments of the trail.

## West End

I started with the western end of the trail, using the parking lot near the Nine Mile Falls dam as a starting point.

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-255-4388", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2025/05/es-255-4388", caption = "Spokane River Centennial State Park Trail, Nine Mile Falls, Washington") }}

Alas, the trail was closed south of the dam for a forest thinning project, so the Deep Creek Bridge (shown below) is as far south as I could go.

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-255-4381", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2025/05/es-255-4381", caption = "Spokane River Centennial State Park Trail, Nine Mile Falls, Washington") }}

After being turned back at the bridge, I turned north and found the trail very much like some of the hiking trails I encountered last year when visiting [Riverside State Park](/riverside).

This led me to the western end of the trail at Nine Mile Recreation Area:

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-255-4399", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2025/05/es-255-4399", caption = "Nine Mile Recreation Area, Nine Mile Falls, Washington") }}

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-255-4401", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2025/05/es-255-4401", caption = "Nine Mile Recreation Area, Nine Mile Falls, Washington") }}

## Donkey Island Trailhead

The Bike Hub crew suggested I spend some time near Donkey Island, so I drove over there and resumed my exploration:

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-255-4408", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2025/05/es-255-4408", caption = "Spokane River Centennial State Park Trail, Millwood, Washington") }}

The trail crosses over the Spokane River a mile or so east of the trailhead. I shot this from the bridge over the river.

There were many short trails off of the bike trail to various swimming holes and rock formations:

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-255-4424", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2025/05/es-255-4424", caption = "Spokane River Centennial State Park Trail, Spokane Valley, Washington") }}

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-255-4431", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2025/05/es-255-4431", caption = "Spokane River Centennial State Park Trail, Spokane Valley, Washington") }}

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-255-4438", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2025/05/es-255-4438", caption = "Spokane River Centennial State Park Trail, Spokane Valley, Washington") }}

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-255-4440", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2025/05/es-255-4440", caption = "Spokane River Centennial State Park Trail, Spokane Valley, Washington") }}

My trusty steed for the day ...

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-255-4450", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2025/05/es-255-4450", caption = "Spokane River Centennial State Park Trail, Spokane Valley, Washington") }}

## State Line Segment

The Spokane River Centennial State Park Trail ends at the state line with Idaho, where it meets the [North Idaho Centennial Trail](https://nictf.org).

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-255-4455", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2025/05/es-255-4455", caption = "Spokane River Centennial State Park Trail, Liberty Lake, Washington") }}

I ventured a short distance past the state line to find this bridge over the Spokane River.

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-255-4460", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2025/05/es-255-4460", caption = "Centennial Trail, Post Falls, Idaho") }}
